how to contribute to some repo?
we forked Assel’s repo
we have cloned fork of  Assel’s repo
we created a branch(srikant) on local clone
we changed few files on local clone
we committed to local clone
we pushed to  fork of Assel’s repo.
we submitted pull request.
Then, Assel approved the PR and merged the branch (srikant) to Assel’s master branch


Assel’s repo : upstream
local clone:  laptop
 fork of Assel’s repo: origin


Assel’s repo (upstream) has latest  changes from everybody
How do we get all the latest changes to our fork?
we added git remote upstream
we switched to master on local clone
we fetched latest changes from upstream.
we merged upstream/master to master (local clone)
we pushed master branch on  local clone to fork(origin)
now origin has all the latest commits from upstream
